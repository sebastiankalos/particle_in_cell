# Instructions and explanations

This repository contains a particle in a cell code that uses a linear solver for the Poisson equation. Three main files compose the full code:
* pic.py 
* pic_functions.py
* pic_classes.py

To run the code, download all 3 files into a common repository and run "pic.py"

Currently, things are set to generate a simulation of 2000 electrons with gaussian 2D initial distribution undergoing coulombic explosion in a potential barrier box.
